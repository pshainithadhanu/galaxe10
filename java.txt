React Life Cycle Methods
-->Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
-->Mounting:
	1.constructor()
	2.getDerivedStateFromProps()
	3.render()
	4.componentDidMount()
-->1.constructor(): The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, 
and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.The constructor method is called, by React, every 
time you make a component.
-->2.getDerivedStateFromProps():The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.
-->3.render():The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.
-->4.componentDidMount():The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.his is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.

--->Updating:
    1.getDerivedStateFromProps()
    2.shouldComponentUpdate()
    3.render()
    4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    5.componentDidUpdate()
--> 1.getDerivedStateFromProps(): Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.
--> 2.shouldComponentUpdate():In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
--> 3.render():The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.
--> 4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate():In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.
	If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method, otherwise you will get an error.
--> 5.componentDidUpdate():The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

-->Unmounting:
	1.componentWillUnmount()
